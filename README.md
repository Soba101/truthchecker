# Truth Wars - Educational Telegram Bot Game

> **Note (2025-07):** The *Drunk* role has been deprecated and removed from gameplay. Any references below are for historical context only and do not reflect current gameplay.

A sophisticated Telegram bot implementing the "Truth Wars" game - an educational multiplayer social deduction experience that teaches media literacy through interactive gameplay. Players vote on headlines to determine if they're real or fake while taking on special roles with unique abilities in a strategic battle between Truth Seekers and Misinformers.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Truth Wars combines social deduction with media literacy education in an engaging 5-round format:

- **5-8 players** engage in a **fixed 5-round structure** (optimized for 45-minute games)
- **Trust/Flag voting** on carefully curated real and fake headlines
- **Dynamic reputation system** starting with 3 RP, becoming Ghost Viewer at 0 RP
- **Role-based gameplay** with strategic abilities:
  - **Fact Checker** (Truth Team) - Gets insider info, can snipe suspected Scammers
  - **Scammer** (Misinformation Team) - Spreads doubt, manipulates votes
  - **Influencer** (Truth Team, 7+ players) - Double-weighted votes (2x voting power)
  - **Normies** (Truth Team) - Standard players, learn through gameplay
- **Snipe abilities** for strategic shadow banning (Rounds 1-4 only)
- **Educational content** seamlessly integrated through gameplay mechanics
- **Win conditions**: First faction to 3 points OR highest combined reputation after 5 rounds

## ✨ Key Features
