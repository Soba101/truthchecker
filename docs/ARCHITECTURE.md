## Core Game Architecture

### 1. Truth Wars Game System

#### Game Manager (`truth_wars_manager.py`)
- **Central orchestrator** for all game sessions
- Manages game lifecycle from lobby to completion
- Handles player actions and state transitions
- Implements win condition logic and scoring
- Coordinates between database, roles, and bot interface

#### Game State Machine (`refined_game_states.py`)
- **Phase-based game progression** through 7 distinct phases:
  1. **LOBBY** - Player joining and game setup
  2. **ROLE_ASSIGNMENT** - Secret role distribution
  3. **HEADLINE_REVEAL** - News headline presentation
  4. **DISCUSSION** - Player debate and analysis (2 minutes)
  5. **VOTING** - Trust/Flag voting on headlines
  6. **SNIPE_OPPORTUNITY** - Special ability usage (rounds 1-4)
  7. **ROUND_RESULTS** - Resolution and educational content

#### Role System (`roles.py`)
- **Dynamic role assignments** based on player count
- **5-6 Players**: Fact Checker, Scammer, Drunk, Normies
- **7+ Players**: Fact Checker, 2x Scammers, Influencer, Drunk, Normies
- **Special abilities**: Snipe powers, double voting, educational content
- **Faction-based gameplay**: Truth Seekers vs Misinformers

## 4. Game Flow Architecture

### Round Structure (5 Rounds Total)

#### 1. **Headline Reveal Phase** (30 seconds)
- AI-generated or curated headline presented
- Difficulty progression: Easy → Medium → Hard
- Educational context provided

#### 2. **Discussion Phase** (2 minutes)
- Players debate headline authenticity
- Fact Checker gets special information (except 1 blind round)
- Drunk player shares media literacy tips
- Shadow banned players cannot speak

#### 3. **Voting Phase** (45 seconds)
- Trust/Flag buttons for each player
- Influencer votes count as 2 votes
- Ghost Viewers (0 RP) can still vote
- Real-time vote tallying

#### 4. **Snipe Phase** (30 seconds, rounds 1-4)
- Fact Checkers and Scammers can use snipe abilities
- Target elimination or self-shadow ban
- Strategic ability usage

#### 5. **Resolution Phase** (30 seconds)
- Reveal headline truth and voting results
- Update player reputations (+1 correct, -1 incorrect)
- Educational explanation and fact-checking tips
- Team scoring: Truth/Scam teams get points

### Win Conditions
1. **First to 3 Points**: Truth Team or Scammer Team reaches 3 points
2. **5 Rounds Complete**: Highest total faction RP wins
3. **All Opposition Eliminated**: Via shadow bans and 0 RP

## 5. Reputation System Architecture

### 3 RP Starting System
- All players start with **3 Reputation Points**
- **Correct votes**: +1 RP (max varies by game state)
- **Incorrect votes**: -1 RP (minimum 0)
- **0 RP = Ghost Viewer**: Can vote but cannot speak

### Special RP Mechanics
- **Scammer bonus**: +1 RP when fake headlines are trusted
- **Influencer weight**: Votes count as 2 points
- **Shadow ban immunity**: 0 RP players cannot be shadow banned

## 6. Shadow Ban System Architecture

### Snipe Abilities
- **Available rounds**: 1, 2, 3, 4 (not round 5)
- **Fact Checker snipe**: Target suspected Scammers
- **Scammer snipe**: Target suspected Fact Checkers
- **Consequences**: Successful = target shadow banned, Failed = self shadow banned

### Shadow Ban Effects
- **Cannot speak** during discussion phases
- **Can still vote** on headlines
- **Duration**: 1 round (may be extended)
- **Visual feedback**: Messages automatically deleted

## 7. Educational Features Architecture

### Drunk Role Rotation
- **Rotates among Normies** each round
- **Provides media literacy tips** during discussion
- **Encourages learning** through peer teaching
- **Tracks educational effectiveness**

### Fact-Checking Integration
- **Real headlines** from credible sources
- **Fake headlines** with common red flags
- **Detailed explanations** after each vote
- **Verification techniques** teaching
- **Source credibility** education

## 8. Performance & Scalability

### Database Optimization
- **Indexed queries** on game_id, user_id, round_number
- **Connection pooling** via AsyncSession
- **Efficient state updates** with minimal queries
- **Cleanup routines** for completed games

### Bot Response Optimization
- **Async handlers** for concurrent game management
- **Efficient message routing** based on chat context
- **Cached game state** in memory for active games
- **Batch operations** for multi-player updates

### Memory Management
- **Active games dictionary** for fast access
- **Automatic cleanup** on game completion
- **Periodic garbage collection** of old game data
- **Resource limits** on concurrent games

## 9. Error Handling & Monitoring

### Comprehensive Error Handling
- **Telegram API errors** (rate limits, blocked users)
- **Database connection issues** with retry logic
- **Game state corruption** recovery
- **User input validation** and sanitization

### Logging Strategy
- **Structured logging** with user/game context
- **Game events tracking** for analytics
- **Performance monitoring** of phase transitions
- **Error reporting** with stack traces

## 10. Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- **Command parameter sanitization**
- **SQL injection prevention** via ORM
- **User permission checks** for game actions
- **Rate limiting** on command usage

### Data Protection
- **User privacy** - minimal data collection
- **Secure token management** for bot authentication
- **Audit trails** for administrative actions
- **GDPR compliance** considerations

## 11. Development Architecture
