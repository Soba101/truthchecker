# Truth Wars Refined Development Progress

## 🎯 Current Status: Refined System Design - ✅ COMPLETED

**Implementation Date:** Current  
**Status:** ✅ Design documentation and role system complete, ready for database implementation

---

## 📊 What We've Built (Refined System)

### ✅ 1.1 Comprehensive Design Documentation

**Files Created:**
- `TRUTH_WARS_REFINED_GAME_DESIGN.md` - Complete refined game design
- `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - Technical implementation plan
- `DATABASE_SCHEMA_REFINED.md` - Database requirements for refined system

**Key Improvements:**
- **Educational Focus**: Game now teaches actual media literacy skills
- **Streamlined Gameplay**: 5-round structure with clear progression
- **Reputation System**: More engaging than elimination-based gameplay
- **Trust/Flag Voting**: Direct interaction with headlines instead of player elimination
- **Shadow Ban Mechanics**: Strategic alternatives to traditional elimination

### ✅ 1.2 Refined Role System

**Files:** `bot/game/roles.py` - **COMPLETELY REWRITTEN**

**New Refined Roles:**

**5-6 Players:**
- **🧠 Fact Checker** (1) - Gets headline truth (except 1 round), snipe ability
- **😈 Scammer** (1) - Knows all headline truth, manipulates votes, snipe ability  
- **🧍 "Drunk"** (1) - Rotating role with headline info + media literacy tips
- **🧍 Normies** (2-3) - Regular players learning media literacy

**7+ Players:**
- **🧠 Fact Checker** (1) - Same abilities as above
- **😈 Scammers** (2) - Multiple misinformers working together
- **🎭 Influencer** (1) - Vote counts double (2x weight)
- **🧍 "Drunk"** (1) - Rotating educational role
- **🧍 Normies** (3+) - Regular players

**Key Features:**
- **Snipe System**: Shadow ban mechanics instead of traditional abilities
- **Reputation Focus**: All roles work within 3 RP → 0 RP system
- **Educational Integration**: "Drunk" role rotates to teach media literacy
- **Strategic Balance**: Simpler but more focused role interactions

### ✅ 1.3 Game Mechanics Revolution

**New Systems Designed:**

**Reputation System:**
- All players start with 3 Reputation Points (RP)
- +1 RP for correct votes, -1 RP for incorrect votes
- +1 RP bonus for Scammers when majority votes incorrectly
- 0 RP = "Ghost Viewer" (can watch, can't vote/talk)

**Trust/Flag Voting:**
- Vote on headlines: **TRUST** (believe real) or **FLAG** (think fake)
- Influencer votes count 2x
- Public voting results with immediate RP updates
- Win conditions: 3 fake headlines trusted = Scammers win, 3 flagged = Truth team wins

**Shadow Ban System:**
- Snipe abilities available rounds 2 & 4
- Failed snipes result in self-shadow ban
- Shadow banned players can't talk during Discussion but can vote
- Strategic confusion: others don't know if banned player was good/evil

**5-Round Structure:**
1. **Headline Reveal** (30s) - Study the headline
2. **Discussion** (3 min) - Debate real vs fake
3. **Voting** (1 min) - Trust or Flag the headline
4. **Results** (45s) - See outcome and RP changes
5. **Snipe** (rounds 2,4 only) - Use shadow ban abilities
