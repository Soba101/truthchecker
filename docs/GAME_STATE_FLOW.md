### **🎯 Round-Specific Logic**

#### **Round Structure (5 Rounds Total)**
- **Round 1**: Standard flow (no snipe)
- **Round 2**: Standard flow + snipe opportunity
- **Round 3**: Standard flow (no snipe)
- **Round 4**: Standard flow + snipe opportunity
- **Round 5**: Standard flow + mandatory game end

#### **Snipe Availability**
```python
snipe_rounds = [2, 4]  # Only rounds 2 and 4 have snipe opportunities
```

#### **Win Condition Checks**
**After Each Round Results:**
1. Check if 3 fake headlines trusted (Scammer win)
2. Check if 3 fake headlines flagged (Truth Team win)
3. Check if 5 rounds completed (Truth Team win by default)
4. Check if all of one faction eliminated/shadow banned

**After Each Snipe Opportunity:**
1. Same win condition checks as above
2. Additional shadow ban faction balance check

## 🚨 **Critical Issues Identified**

### **❌ Issue 1: Missing Game End Transition**
**Expected:** `round_results (Round 5) -> game_end`
**Actual:** Game continues indefinitely after Round 5
**Root Cause:** Win condition check not triggering game end after 5 rounds

### **❌ Issue 2: Missing Win Condition Logging**
**Expected:** Log entries showing win condition checks after each round
**Actual:** No win condition check logs visible
**Root Cause:** `_check_headline_win_conditions()` not being called or failing silently

### **❌ Issue 3: State Machine Counter Discrepancy**
**Expected:** Win condition counters updated after each round
**Actual:** Unknown - no logging of counter values
**Root Cause:** Possibly `update_win_condition_counters()` not called

### **✅ Issue 4: Snipe Phases Working Correctly**
**Expected:** Snipe opportunities in rounds 2 and 4 only
**Actual:** ✅ Correctly triggered in rounds 2 and 4
**Status:** Working as designed

### **⚠️ Issue 5: Drunk Role Rotation Failing**
**Expected:** Drunk role rotates among normies each round
**Actual:** "No normies available for drunk rotation" every round
**Root Cause:** Single-player game has no normies to rotate

---

## 🔧 **Required Fixes**

### **High Priority**
1. **Fix Game End Transition**
   - Ensure `_should_end_game()` properly checks for 5 rounds completed
   - Force transition to `GAME_END` after Round 5 results

2. **Add Win Condition Logging**
   - Log win condition check results after each round
   - Log current counter values (fake_headlines_trusted/flagged)

3. **Verify Counter Updates**
   - Ensure `update_win_condition_counters()` is called in `_resolve_voting()`
   - Log counter changes for debugging

### **Medium Priority**
4. **Handle Single Player Edge Case**
   - Skip drunk rotation when no normies available
   - Adjust win conditions for single-player testing

5. **Add Phase Transition Validation**
   - Validate that all expected phases are reached
   - Add safety checks for infinite loops

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Examine** `_should_end_game()` method implementation
2. **Check** if win conditions are properly evaluated after Round 5
3. **Verify** that state machine counters are being updated
4. **Add** comprehensive logging for win condition checks
5. **Test** complete 5-round game flow with proper termination

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **🎯 Primary Issue: Game End Logic Desynchronization**

**Problem**: Game reaches Round 5 but never transitions to `GAME_END` phase.

**Root Cause**: The state machine and game manager track round numbers independently, causing desynchronization in win condition checks.

#### **🔧 Specific Issues Found:**

1. **State Machine Round Counter Mismatch**
   - `RefinedGameStateMachine.round_number` is managed independently
   - `game_session["round_number"]` is updated separately in `_resolve_voting`
   - Win condition check `self.round_number >= self.max_rounds` fails because state machine round is behind

2. **Win Condition Data Not Passed**
   - State machine's `_should_end_game` checks `game_state.get("fake_headlines_trusted", 0)`
   - But `_get_game_state` pulls from state machine counters, not game_session win_progress
   - Win condition counters from game_session are not being passed to state machine

3. **Win Progress Tracking Inconsistency**
   - `game_session["win_progress"]` is updated in `_resolve_voting`
   - But `_get_game_state` gets counters from `state_machine.fake_headlines_trusted`
   - These two data sources can be out of sync

#### **🎯 Expected vs Actual Data Flow:**

**Expected:**
```
Round 5 Results → Update win_progress → Check if rounds_completed >= 5 → End game
```

**Actual:**
```
Round 5 Results → Update win_progress → Check state_machine.round_number >= 5 → Fails → Continue
```

#### **🔧 Fix Implementation Required:**

1. **Synchronize Round Numbers**
   - Update state machine round_number when game_session round_number changes
   - Or use game_session as single source of truth

2. **Fix Win Condition Data Passing**
   - Pass complete win_progress data from game_session to state machine
   - Ensure state machine gets accurate win condition counters

3. **Add Mandatory 5-Round End Check**
   - Force game end after Round 5 regardless of other conditions
   - Add failsafe check in transition logic

4. **Enhance Win Condition Logging**
   - Log all win condition checks for debugging
   - Display current progress after each round

---

## 🛠️ **Proposed Fixes**

### **Fix 1: Synchronize Round Numbers**
```python
# In _resolve_voting method
# After updating game_session round_number, sync state machine
if "state_machine" in game_session:
    game_session["state_machine"].round_number = game_session["round_number"]
```

### **Fix 2: Enhanced Game State Passing**
```python
# In _get_game_state method
# Pass complete win_progress data
return {
    # ... existing fields ...
    "win_progress": game_session.get("win_progress", {}),
    "rounds_completed": game_session.get("win_progress", {}).get("rounds_completed", 0)
}
```

### **Fix 3: Mandatory 5-Round End Check**
```python
# In _should_end_game method
# Add explicit 5-round check
if game_state.get("rounds_completed", 0) >= 5:
    return True
```

### **Fix 4: Enhanced Win Condition Logging**
```python
# In _should_end_game method
# Add comprehensive logging
logger.info(f"Win condition check: rounds_completed={game_state.get('rounds_completed', 0)}, "
           f"fake_trusted={game_state.get('fake_headlines_trusted', 0)}, "
           f"fake_flagged={game_state.get('fake_headlines_flagged', 0)}")
```

---

## 🎯 **Implementation Priority**

1. **🔴 Critical**: Fix round synchronization (Fix 1)
2. **🔴 Critical**: Fix win condition data passing (Fix 2)
3. **🟠 High**: Add mandatory 5-round end check (Fix 3)
4. **🟡 Medium**: Enhance logging (Fix 4)

---

## 📊 **Expected Outcome After Fixes**

**Fixed Flow:**
```
Round 5 Results → Update win_progress & sync state machine → Check rounds_completed >= 5 → TRUE → Transition to GAME_END
```

**Success Metrics:**
- Game automatically ends after Round 5 ✅
- Win condition logging shows accurate progress ✅
- State machine and game session stay synchronized ✅
- Phase transition success rate: 100% (12/12 transitions) ✅

## 🧹 **CODE CLEANUP: Dual State Machine Issue**

### **⚠️ Issue Discovered**
During the analysis, we found **two different state machine implementations** in the codebase:

#### **✅ Active: `refined_game_states.py`**
- **Status**: Currently used by `truth_wars_manager.py`
- **Purpose**: Implements new 5-round headline-based Truth Wars design
- **Phases**: `LOBBY → ROLE_ASSIGNMENT → HEADLINE_REVEAL → DISCUSSION → VOTING → ROUND_RESULTS → SNIPE_OPPORTUNITY → GAME_END`

#### **❌ Legacy: `game_states.py`** 
- **Status**: **UNUSED** - was imported in handlers but never called
- **Purpose**: Old traditional social deduction game design  
- **Phases**: `LOBBY → ROLE_ASSIGNMENT → NEWS → DISCUSSION → VOTING → RESOLUTION → GAME_END`

### **🔧 Cleanup Performed**
1. **Removed unused import** from `bot/handlers/truth_wars_handlers.py`
2. **Confirmed no other files** import the legacy `game_states.py`

### **📝 Recommendation**
Consider deleting `bot/game/game_states.py` entirely since it's completely unused and could cause confusion for future developers.

## ✅ **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **🔧 Fix 1: Round Number Synchronization** ✅
**File:** `bot/game/truth_wars_manager.py`
**Location:** `_resolve_voting` method
**Change:** Added round number synchronization between state machine and game session
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Synchronize state machine round number with game session
if "state_machine" in game_session:
    game_session["state_machine"].round_number = game_session["round_number"]
    logger.info(f"Synchronized state machine round number to {game_session['round_number']}")
```

### **🔧 Fix 2: Win Condition Data Passing** ✅
**File:** `bot/game/truth_wars_manager.py`
**Location:** `_get_game_state` method
**Change:** Enhanced game state to pass complete win progress data
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Pass both state machine counters AND game session win progress
"fake_headlines_trusted": max(fake_headlines_trusted, win_progress.get("fake_headlines_trusted", 0)),
"fake_headlines_flagged": max(fake_headlines_flagged, win_progress.get("fake_headlines_flagged", 0)),
"win_progress": win_progress,
"rounds_completed": win_progress.get("rounds_completed", 0),
```

### **🔧 Fix 3: Mandatory 5-Round End Check** ✅
**File:** `bot/game/refined_game_states.py`
**Location:** `_should_end_game` method
**Change:** Added explicit 5-round completion check as primary win condition
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Check for 5 rounds completed (mandatory end condition)
rounds_completed = game_state.get("rounds_completed", 0)
if rounds_completed >= 5:
    logger.info(f"Game should end: 5 rounds completed ({rounds_completed})")
    return True
```

### **🔧 Fix 4: Comprehensive Win Condition Logging** ✅
**File:** `bot/game/refined_game_states.py`
**Location:** `_should_end_game` method
**Change:** Added detailed logging for all win condition checks
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Comprehensive win condition logging
logger.info(f"Win condition check: rounds_completed={rounds_completed}, "
           f"fake_trusted={fake_trusted}, fake_flagged={fake_flagged}, "
           f"state_machine_round={self.round_number}, max_rounds={self.max_rounds}")
```

---

## 📊 **EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIXES**

### **✅ Fixed Phase Transition Flow**
```
Round 5: headline_reveal → discussion → voting → round_results → 
Win Condition Check: rounds_completed=5 → TRUE → 
Phase Transition: round_results → GAME_END → 
Game Successfully Terminates
```

### **✅ Enhanced Logging Output**
```
[INFO] Win condition check: rounds_completed=5, fake_trusted=0, fake_flagged=0, state_machine_round=5, max_rounds=5
[INFO] Game should end: 5 rounds completed (5)
[INFO] Phase transition: round_results -> game_end, Round: 5
[INFO] Game be0c2413-3345-439e-afcc-bc693b65959d transitioned to phase: game_end
```

### **✅ Synchronized Game State**
- **State Machine Round**: Always matches game session round
- **Win Progress Counters**: Accurately passed from game session to state machine
- **Win Condition Logic**: Uses both fallback checks and primary round completion

### **✅ Robust Game End Logic**
1. **Primary Check**: `rounds_completed >= 5` (from game_session)
2. **Fallback Check**: `state_machine.round_number >= 5` (state machine)
3. **Win Condition Checks**: 3 fake headlines trusted/flagged
4. **Shadow Ban Checks**: All players of one faction eliminated
