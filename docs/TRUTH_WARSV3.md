# 🕵️‍♂️ Truth Wars v3 – Streamlined Rules 🕵️‍♀️
> **Note (2025-07):** The *Drunk* role described in earlier drafts has been removed from gameplay. Ignore related rows/rules.
## 1. Player Roles

| Role | Count | Powers & Constraints |
|------|-------|----------------------|
| 🧠 **Fact Checker** | 1 | • May *peek* at the headline's truth up to **3× per game**, **never in two consecutive rounds**.<br/>• After initial votes (Rounds 1–4 only) may **snipe** 1 player *once per game*.  If the target is a **Scammer**, they are immediately shadow-banned; if not, nothing happens.  Sniping is **forbidden in Round 5**. |
| 😈 **Scammer** | 1 (5–6 p) / 2 (7–10 p) | • Always knows the real/fake status of the headline.<br/>• Tries to steer the majority toward wrong answers.<br/>• If shadow-banned or successfully sniped, they are out. |
| 🧍 **Misinformed Users** | remaining | • No special powers.<br/>• If shadow-banned, they are out. |
| 🎭 **Influencer** | 1 (7–10 p) | • Your vote counts as **2 votes** instead of 1.<br/>• No other special knowledge or abilities. |

## 2. Headline Setup

1. Prepare two headline pools (**5 each**):
   * **Set A:** 3 real / 2 fake
   * **Set B:** 2 real / 3 fake
2. Shuffle both pools.
3. Randomly pick **one set** for the whole game.  This keeps overall balance yet hides exact distribution.

---

## 3. Round Structure (max 5 rounds)

1. **Headline Reveal** – Show next headline.
2. **Discussion (3 min)** – Open debate.  Silence or refusal to explain is suspicious.
   * Fact Checker may *peek* **now** (obeys cooldown rule).
3. **Initial Vote** – Everyone votes **Trust** or **Flag**.
   * A **tie** scores **no points** for either team.
4. **Fact Checker Snipe** – Rounds 1-4 only.  May target one player (see Role table).
5. **Shadow-Ban Vote** – Rounds 2-5.  Verbal vote to silence one player.
   * **Tie → revote once**; if still tied, **no ban**.
6. **Scoring Update** – See Section 4.
7. **Round End** – Announce scores and eliminated players, then proceed.

## 4. Scoring Rules

| Majority Outcome | +1 Point To |
|------------------|-------------|
| Fake headline **flagged** | **Truth Team** |
| Real headline **trusted** | **Truth Team** |
| Fake headline **trusted** | **Scammers** |
| Real headline **flagged** | **Scammers** |

No points are given on a voting tie.

## 5. Win & End Conditions

The game ends immediately when **any** of these happen (otherwise after 5 rounds):

* **Scammers** reach **3 points**.
* **Truth Team** reach **3 points** *or* all Scammers are shadow-banned.
* After 5 rounds, if neither side has 3 points → **Tie**.

---

## 6. Variants & Balancing Knobs

* Reduce Fact-Checker peeks to *2* if Truth side dominates in play-tests.
* Make the Drunk's hint only **70 % accurate** for harder mode.
* Extend shadow-ban vote to Round 1 for a more cut-throat opening.
* Introduce a minor penalty (‐1 team point) for any player who refuses to vote.

---

## 7. Edge-Case Clarifications (for smooth play)

* A player eliminated by **snipe** is **not** eligible for that round's shadow-ban vote.
* Shadow-banned players cannot talk *or* vote for the rest of the game.
* If the headline deck exhausts early (e.g. an extra round from variant rules), reuse unused headlines from the other set.
* Hosts should display a clear "Phase Tracker" so everyone knows the current step.
