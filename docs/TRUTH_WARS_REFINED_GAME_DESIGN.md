- Players with **0 RP** become "Ghost Viewers" (watch only, can't vote)

### **📰 Round Structure (5 Rounds Total)**

AI generates a headline (real or fake):
- *"Eating eggs daily increases the risk of memory loss, new study says."*
- *"Octopuses can taste with their arms."* (true)
- *"Wearing wireless earbuds for more than 2 hours daily linked to brain cancer."*
- *"A Harvard study found alkaline water drinkers are 40% less likely to get cancer."*

#### **2. Discussion Phase (3 minutes)**
- All players debate the headline's authenticity
- **Scammers** try to create doubt or push false certainty
- **Truth Seekers** guide debate subtly  
- **Silence is suspicious** - all must participate

#### **3. Trust/Flag Vote**
- Players vote: **TRUST** (believe it's real) or **FLAG** (think it's fake)
- **Influencer** vote counts as 2 votes
- Public voting results displayed

#### **4. Reputation Updates**
**Correct Votes:**
