## 🎮 **Game Mechanics**

### **🌟 Reputation System**
- All players start with **3 Reputation Points (RP)**
- Gain/lose RP based on voting accuracy and game events
- Players with **0 RP** become "Ghost Viewers" (watch only, can't vote)

### **📰 Round Structure (5 Rounds Total)**

#### **1. AI Headline Drop**
AI generates a headline (real or fake):
- *"Eating eggs daily increases the risk of memory loss, new study says."*
- *"Octopuses can taste with their arms."* (true)
- *"Wearing wireless earbuds for more than 2 hours daily linked to brain cancer."*
- *"A Harvard study found alkaline water drinkers are 40% less likely to get cancer."*

#### **2. Discussion Phase (3 minutes)**
- All players debate the headline's authenticity
- **Scammers** try to create doubt or push false certainty
- **Truth Seekers** guide debate subtly  
- **Silence is suspicious** - all must participate

#### **3. Trust/Flag Vote**
- Players vote: **TRUST** (believe it's real) or **FLAG** (think it's fake)
- **Influencer** vote counts as 2 votes
- Public voting results displayed

#### **4. Reputation Updates**
**Correct Votes:**
- Supporting true headlines → **+1 RP**
- Flagging fake headlines → **+1 RP**

**Incorrect Votes:**
- Voting TRUST on fake headline → **-1 RP**
- Voting FLAG on true headline → **-1 RP**

**Special Bonus:**
- If majority gets wrong option → **Scammers get +1 RP**

## 🎭 **Special Role Abilities**

## 📊 **Example Round Flow**

2. **Discussion**: Players debate for 3 minutes
   - Fact Checker knows it's fake (subtly guides discussion)

## 🚨 **Game Design Analysis: Potential Loopholes & Issues**

### **⚠️ Critical Issues Identified**

#### **1. Reputation System Vulnerabilities**
**Issue**: Everyone could become Ghost Viewers (0 RP)
- If most players make wrong votes early, they lose voting power
- Game becomes unplayable with no active voters
- **Solution**: Implement minimum 1 RP floor or reputation recovery mechanics

**Issue**: No protection against reputation manipulation
- Scammers get +1 RP when majority is wrong, creating unfair advantage
- **Solution**: Cap bonus RP or make it conditional on Scammer participation

#### **2. Role Balance Problems**
**Issue**: Fact Checker overpowered
- Knows correct answer 4 out of 5 rounds
- Can easily dominate game with perfect information
- **Solution**: Reduce to 3 out of 5 rounds or add misinformation risk

**Issue**: Influencer 2x vote too powerful in small groups
- In 5-6 player games, Influencer controls 2/5 or 2/6 of total votes
- Can single-handedly decide outcomes
- **Solution**: Scale vote weight by group size (1.5x in small groups)

**Issue**: "Drunk" role rotation breaks with insufficient normies
- Simulation shows no normies available for rotation
- Role becomes meaningless or causes errors
- **Solution**: Allow any non-special role to be "drunk" or remove rotation

#### **3. Win Condition Logic Flaws**
**Issue**: Win conditions assume balanced headline distribution
- "3 fake headlines trusted/flagged" assumes 3+ fake headlines exist
- Random generation might create 4 real, 1 fake scenario
- **Solution**: Guarantee balanced headline distribution (2-3 fake, 2-3 real)

**Issue**: Truth Team heavily favored
- Default win after 5 rounds regardless of performance
- RP-based victory calculation as tiebreaker also favors Truth Team
- **Solution**: More balanced endgame conditions

**Issue**: Unclear tie-breaking in voting
- What happens if Trust and Flag votes are equal?
- **Solution**: Define clear tie-breaking rules (abstains, coin flip, etc.)

#### **4. Shadow Ban System Inconsistencies**
**Issue**: Shadow banned players can still vote
- Punishment doesn't match severity of being "eliminated"
- Players might prefer shadow ban over active participation
- **Solution**: Remove voting rights for shadow banned players

**Issue**: Snipe timing creates unfair gaps
- Only available rounds 2 and 4, not 1, 3, 5
- Critical late-game sniping impossible
- **Solution**: Allow sniping in rounds 2, 3, 4 or 2, 4, 5

#### **5. Information Asymmetry Exploitation**
**Issue**: Scammers could reveal roles to break game
- No mechanism prevents "I'm the Scammer" declarations
- Could chaos-strategy by revealing all roles
- **Solution**: Add in-game penalties for role revelation

**Issue**: Fact Checker has no misdirection protection
- Always acts in Truth Team's favor, easily identifiable
- **Solution**: Occasionally give Fact Checker wrong information

#### **6. Player Behavior Manipulation**
**Issue**: Silent players face no consequences
- "Silence is suspicious" but no enforcement mechanism
- Players could game by staying quiet
- **Solution**: Force participation through voting penalties

**Issue**: Abstaining has no cost
- Simulation shows abstaining gives 0 RP change
- Could be exploited to avoid all risk
- **Solution**: Add small penalty for abstaining

#### **7. Voting System Exploits**
**Issue**: Vote weight imbalance
- Influencer + regular player can overpower multiple opponents
- Mathematical advantage too strong
- **Solution**: Implement diminishing returns on vote weight

**Issue**: No anti-coalition mechanics
- Players could pre-agree on voting patterns
- **Solution**: Add uncertainty elements or role swapping

### **🔧 Recommended Fixes**

#### **High Priority:**
1. **Reputation Floor**: Minimum 1 RP to prevent Ghost Viewer deadlock
2. **Role Balance**: Reduce Fact Checker advantage, scale Influencer power
3. **Win Condition Guarantee**: Ensure balanced headline distribution
4. **Shadow Ban Consistency**: Remove voting rights for shadow banned players

#### **Medium Priority:**
5. **Tie-Breaking Rules**: Define clear voting tie resolution
6. **Participation Enforcement**: Penalize silence and abstaining
7. **Anti-Reveal Mechanics**: Discourage role revelation

#### **Low Priority:**
8. **Coalition Prevention**: Add uncertainty to reduce pre-gaming
9. **Late-Game Balance**: Allow more strategic timing for abilities

### **🎯 Game Flow Improvements**

**Issue**: Phase transitions unclear
- Players may not understand when to act
- **Solution**: Clear phase indicators and countdown timers

**Issue**: Learning curve too steep
- Complex role interactions hard to grasp quickly
- **Solution**: Simplified tutorial mode or role cards

**Issue**: Endgame feels rushed
- No climactic final round mechanics
- **Solution**: Add final round special rules or reveal mechanics

## 🔍 **Conclusion**

The Truth Wars game design has strong educational value and engaging mechanics, but contains several exploitable loopholes that could break gameplay. The most critical issues are:

1. **Reputation system** could eliminate all players from voting
2. **Role balance** heavily favors informed players
3. **Win conditions** don't guarantee achievable objectives
4. **Shadow ban system** lacks consistency

Addressing these issues would create a more balanced, fair, and engaging experience while maintaining the core educational objectives.
